## Bible verse of the Day: 
> ✝️ **“Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?	 	
   But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.	 	
 	  Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.	 	
	   They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:	 	
 	  They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:	 	
 	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.”**  
> — *Psalm 115:2-7*
