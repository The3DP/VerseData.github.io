## Bible verse of the Day: 
> ✞ **“Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised,
> And his words are not heard. Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard
> Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war;
> But one sinner destroys much good.”**  
> — *Ecclesiastes 9:4*
