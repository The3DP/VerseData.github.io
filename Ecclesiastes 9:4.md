######Bible verse featured for Februrary 10th, 2026:
 
 “Wisdom is better than strength. 
 Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, And his words are not heard.
 Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools.
 Wisdom is better than weapons of war; But one sinner destroys much good.”

- *Ecclesiastes 9:4*
